# FruitNinja

Created as a final project for my Game-Programming course, Fruit Ninja is a popular game that combines skill and precision with juicy, addictive fun. This fast-paced game challenges players to become a master fruit-slicer using a mouse as a virtual blade. Colorful fruits are tossed into the air, and players must slash across the screen to slice them in half while avoiding slicing any bombs.
